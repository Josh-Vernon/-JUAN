                  <p class="P-content"> Philippines, island country of Southeast Asia in the western Pacific Ocean. It is an archipelago consisting of more than 7,000 islands and islets lying about 500 miles (800 km) off the coast of Vietnam. The Philippines takes its name from Philip II, who was king of Spain during the Spanish colonization of the islands in the 16th century. Because it was under Spanish rule for 333 years and under U.S. tutelage for a further 48 years, the Philippines has many cultural affinities with the West.</p>

                <p class="P-content">The Portuguese navigator and explorer Ferdinand Magellan headed the first Spanish foray to the Philippines when he made landfall on Cebu in March 1521; a short time later he met an untimely death on the nearby island of Mactan. After King Philip II had dispatched three further expeditions that ended in disaster, he sent out Miguel López de Legazpi, who established the first permanent Spanish settlement, in Cebu, in 1565. The Spanish city of Manila was founded in 1571, and by the end of the 16th century most of the coastal and lowland areas from Luzon to northern Mindanao were under Spanish control. Friars marched with soldiers and soon accomplished the nominal conversion to Roman Catholicism of all the local people under Spanish administration.</p>

Their advance was rapid; before Christmas, Manila was declared an “open city,” while Quezon and Osmeña were evacuated to MacArthur`s headquarters on Corregidor Island. Despite a desire, at one point, to return to Manila in order to surrender, Quezon was persuaded to leave the Philippines in March 1942 on a U.S. submarine; he was never to return. Osmeña also went. Filipino and American forces, under Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright, surrendered in May. An Executive Commission made up of more than 30 members of the old Filipino political elite had been cooperating with Japanese military authorities in Manila since January.</p>

                <p>Mayon Volcano is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Philippines and is a top attraction in any Bicol tour. </p>
                <p>The name Mayon comes from the Bicolano word magayon,which means beautiful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the top natural landmarks in the Philippines and one of the most-visited tourist spots in Albay, it is already a wonderful experience seeing the volcano from afar. But if you are an adrenaline junkie, you can soak up all its beauty while gliding through a zipline in Lignon Hill or going on a Mayon Volcano tour via a Mayon ATV ride in Bicol.

                <p>
                  Hand-chiseled some 2000 years ago, the Banaue Rice Terraces in Banaue of Ifugao, North Luzon, is a remarkable destination and is truly one of the most beautiful places in the Philippines and regarded as one of the Philippines' iconic landmarks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sit in a colorful jeepney as it cruises along winding roads in Banaue, and views of dramatic mud-walled rice terraces leave you in awe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Banaue and its many natural attractions may pack a lot of tourists so you can make your way further to quieter Batad Rice Terraces and take a quick dip at its mighty Tappiya waterfalls. You can also explore nearby Baguio City or pick fresh strawberries in La Trinidad, Benguet. Check out Baguio hotels that you can book for your trip.

                  The walled city of Intramuros in Manila, one of the top landmarks in the Philippines. This 64-hectare Spanish fortress was erected by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and was destroyed by the end of World War II.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ruins remain very alive today and are some of the top Instagrammable places in Manila. The area can be explored via Intramuros tours or a Manila bike tour. The area has become home to several universities and establishments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another Intramuros attraction is Fort Santiago, a citadel that served as headquarters for armies and foreign powers. It is a historically significant site where the national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, was imprisoned before his execution.

                  Long hailed as one of the best white sand beaches in the Philippines and the entire world, Boracay`s claim to fame is its 4-kilometer stretch of pure white, powdery sand called White Beach
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those who want to indulge during their holiday can also do so as Boracay is home to some of the best 5-star hotels in the Philippines, as well as several honeymoon resorts and some of the best beach resorts in the Philippines. You can also have a workcation here.

                <p>The geological wonder on the island of Bohol known as the Chocolate    Hills is a unique natural phenomenon that features more than 1,200 small mountains that emerged above the ground over several centuries.
                </p>
                <p>The area was once under the ocean, and these unique hills expand in every direction. They are green during much of the year, but during the dry season, they turn to a chocolate-brown color, thus the name, chocolate hills.
                </p>
                <p>A convenient path leads to the top of a lookout area, which provides the best view. Be sure to observe the many delicate flowers along the walkway that are unique to this area.

              <p class="flow-text">
                Biko is a sweet and chewy rice cake made from glutinous rice, brown sugar, and coconut milk.  It is one of the easiest delicacies to cook as the glutinous rice is cooked the same way rice is cooked.

              <p class="flow-text">
                It is then added into the brown sugar and coconut milk mixture being cooked in low heat.  Although not necessary, biko is commonly topped with latik and traditionally served as patties served atop or wrapped in banana leaves.

                This puto recipe will give you airy, light and slightly sweet steamed rice cakes which are a Filipino classic. As a kid, there was always puto served on the dessert table at our family parties (or boodle fights) and they were always the perfect bite-sized pieces to sneak before dinner would start.

              <p class="flow-text">
                The word puto comes from the Malay word “puttu,” which means “portioned.” This makes sense considering most of the time, puto is made in mini muffin or cupcake molds that are around one to one and half inches-the perfect portion if you ask me.

            <h1>Philippine Festivals</h1>
            <p>
              A festival or commonly known as a “Fiesta” is part of the Filipino culture. Each city or province has a local fiesta. Being a very religious centered country, a fiesta is commonly about the celebration of a city or province's patron saint or of harvest. There is a fiesta going on at any time in the Philippines. A fiesta is a special time with a banquet for kin and friends. They are always colorful and unique.

            <p>
              Angono, Rizal is known as the “Art Capital of the Philippines.” Aside from this, the town is also famous for its Higantes Festival.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on the Angono folklore, the “Higantes” or paper-mache giants were done by locals as a form of protest during the Spanish colonization. Now, these paper-mache giants now play the part of one of the most unique festivals in the Philippines. Higantes Festival is celebrated every 4th week of November in Angono, Rizal to honor San Clemente, the town`s patron saint.
